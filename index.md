###  A Cancer Signaling Lab
* * *
The major focus of the Wan lab is on the mechanisms of how protein post-translational modifications shape the proteomic network and how cancer cells rewire central signaling pathways to gain proliferative advantage as well as to remodel the tumor microenvironment. Our goals are to understand the complexity and heterogeneity of human cancers, and to use such knowledge to identify novel cancer therapeutic strategies.
